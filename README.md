# Space CowBoy

Project by: James Talerico, Alessandro Power, Michael Monteferrante, David Desmarais-Michaud

The commands are mapped to the (W,S)keys, the backspace and the spacebar, left Control key,
the mouse left and right buttons, and the cursor.

Additionally the l, p, and t keys allows you to view the world as lines, points, and triangles.   

The main movement keys are W for acceleration and S for deceleration, continuing to press or hold S will 
eventually make the camera move in reverse.

The spacebar stops movement completely, and the backspace will reset the camera to the starting position
of the world.

Holding down the control key will set the camera to free mode and will allow you to look around without changing 
the direction of the camera. 

The cursor is used to control the direction the camera is looking in and the direction in which we are moving.

the left and right mouse buttons set the left and right tilt respectively on the spaceship and affect 
the sensitivity of the cursor for turning.
